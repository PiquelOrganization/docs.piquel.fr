# docs.piquel.fr

My own homemade, self-hosted gitbook alternative

## TODO

- Verify Github signature in webhook
- Render the documentation based on requirements
- add HOME_ROUTE to make a homemage
- make reading files concurrent (every getFilesFromDir call should be goroutine)
- in RouterOutput: static files not being added properly if nested
